Create your own components powered by GSAP by just adding attributes.
Accessible, customizable, open-source.

## Introduction

An open-source library of fully customizable and accessible components for creating UI elements using attributes

Socks UI allows you to customize components to your heart's desire without sacrificing time or accessibility. It turns your beautiful group of divs into accessible, interactive elements powered by GSAP.

## Features

### Attribute-based

You don't need to write any code. Make it look the way you want, then add the appropriate attributes to bring your elements to life! This way, you can create components way faster than before.

### Accessible by default

Developers often don't bother with accessibility as it takes a lot of time and effort to properly follow the standards. With Socks UI, accessibility is not an after-thought, but rather a core feature. All our components follow WAI-ARIA design patterns so that you can focus on creating.

### Useful Error Messages

Socks UI checks that your components have the right attributes at every step. If you mistype or forget to add one, you will get an error in the console that points you to the element you should check.

### Open Source

The code for all the components is available for free on Github, where anyone can contribute to growing and improving this library. It uses plain Typescript and compiles to minified Common JS files.
